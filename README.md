When I started this project, I had knowledge about programming languages, but zero about Golang. That was my motivation. I 
really wanted to get into this language. It is well established in the market, it's fast and easy to learn, and I`m a very
curious person too.
The project consists of a game, the rock-paper-scissors game, which is built in the Udemy course named above. Creating this 
project while following the course, allowed me to learn the Golang basis, how certain things are implemented differently than
other languages, what things can you do with it, and what you can't, benefits, and so on.
I highly recommend to take this course, especially if you are new to Go.
Good luck!

To start playing, clone the repository and run "go run main.go" inside "source" folder.
The app runs on 8080 port, so click on http://localhost:8080/ to see the game.
No dependencies needed.

Have fun!
